## Description
1. Use machine learning to predict what restaurants the user would like to try in a new area based off of:
   -Past choices (manually input your favorite places to eat + gathered data through app usage) 
   -Personality data (IBM Watson API)
   -Google Location (only show results that are within a radius)
   -Also can check weather so hot noodle place for cold day, ice cream for hot day etc...
