   - (optional) Personality data (IBM Watson API)
   - Google Location (only show results that are within a radius)
   - (optional) Can check weather so hot noodle place for cold day, ice cream for hot day etc.

2. (optional) Restaurants can be saved
   - User can create custom lists. For example: "dessert/authentic/etc"

3. (optional) Can predict for multiple people
   - User can add friends and the app will use their data as well for group decisions

## Technologies
